This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Bracket Position ----
# Got the bracket to appear, can we position it.
# This SO answer looks promising:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31690007/ggplot-drawing-line-between-points-across-facets


# Idea is to grab the location of where we want the end points of the bracket in NPC notation.

# This perofmrs the steps to render but doesn't render, so we can find the position of things.
gb <- ggplot_build(plot_mean_99var)

# returns the grobs of an object that can then be manipulated
g <- ggplot_gtable(gb)


# this is pipeable but we need the gb object to extract the ranges
# g <- plot_mean_99var %>%
#   ggplot_build() %>%
#   ggplot_gtable()

```
